    "- Maximum number of players is 6. If the given number exceeds 6 players, the number of players is set to 6.\n",
    "- By default, each player is given 100 dollars.\n",
    "- Minimum bet is 20 dollars.\n",
    "- Jack, Queen, and King are treated as equivalents of 10 when splitting.\n",
    "- A player can split up to three times in a round, resulting in four hands maximum. \n",
    "- A player cannot split aces.\n",
    "- A 21 after split is not considered Blackjack.\n",
    "- You earn 1.5 times your bet for Blackjack.\n",
    "- No surrender.\n",
    "- No insurance.\n",
    "- If a player chooses not to play for the given round, the result will be shown 'lose' but the total amount of money will remain unchanged.\n",
    "- Game ends when there are no players left.\n",
    "- It is assumed that the number inputs are given in non-negative integers.\n",
